                <h3>Do You Need it?</h3>
                <p>
                    To answer this question, tell us if you have a good-sized
                    kitchen or one of those tiny apartment kitchens. A
                    good-sized kitchen gives you the creative freedom to pick
                    whatever you want. But if you have a small kitchen, you
                    might want to give a thought and choose only what you would
                    use. Spatulas, spoons (stirring and serving), ladles, wire
                    whisk, grater, peeler and measuring cups are an absolute
                    must. On the other hand, you also have a pizza cutter,
                    zester, masher, etc which can be optional. When it comes to
                    pots and pans, kadai of various sizes, frying pans and tawas
                    are an absolute must. THEIR USES 1. Tongs Tongs deserve the
                    top spot on this list because it is one of the most useful
                    kitchen utensils. In a nutshell, it is a kitchen utensil
                    that is used to hold things, in cooking and serving food.
                    Technically speaking, cooks use tongs to grip or hold food
                    items. In the kitchen, food items often become too hot or
                    too cold. As a result, you cannot hold them with your bare
                    hands. Tongs solve this problem. By gripping extremely hot
                    or cold food items, you donâ€™t have to put your precious
                    hands at risk. In addition, you can use tongs to handle food
                    that you do not want to handle with your hands. These
                    include breading, sticky food, and mixing greens. 2. Slotted
                    Spoon As its name suggests, a slotted spoon is a large
                    kitchen utensil with slots or holes. With a long handle and
                    properly positioned holes, the slotted spoon works to keep
                    your hands away from food items with extreme temperatures.
                    Slotted spoons come in several materials, shapes, and sizes.
                    To choose a slotted spoon that best suits your needs, you
                    must consider the type of food you frequently prepare. You
                    must also consider the size of the holes and the heat
                    resistance of the materials. A slotted spoon becomes
                    extremely useful when preparing soups, pasta, stew,
                    deep-fried items, and the like. 3. Large Spoon Speaking of
                    spoons, you must consider getting another spoon. This time,
                    you must consider getting a large spoon, A large spoon can
                    be used to do a lot of things. These include stirring,
                    mixing, serving, and transferring food.

                <h4>Is it of Good Quality?</h4>
                <p>
                    How can you differentiate between an off the rack cheap
                    vessel or utensil and a quality product? It is not quite
                    easy unless you go for branded products like Prestige or
                    Wonderchef. A high-quality product would go for a longer
                    period of time without any need for replacement or repairs.
                    A quality vessel distributes heat evenly and doesn't scratch
                    easily; A good spoon and ladle would not disturb the coating
                    on your vessel. Invest in a quality product that stays with
                    you for years and throughout your cooking adventure.
                </p>
                <h5>Does it Exceed Your Budget?</h5>
                <p>
                    As with every purchase, plan your budget before jumping the
                    gun. It is not wise to stock your kitchen at the expense of
                    a hole in your purse. Go for the kitchen essentials that you
                    simply cannot do without. As for the rest, reach for cheaper
                    products until you can pitch in for quality products.
                    Another tip when on a tight budget is to go for individual
                    products and not a set. Sets can be pretty expensive, but
                    with individual products, you get to choose your most
                    essential needs.
